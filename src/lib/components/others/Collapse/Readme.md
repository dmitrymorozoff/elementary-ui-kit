        The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic
        egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.

        <br />
        Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that
        lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The animal is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae)
        and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.

    <CollapseTitle>Penguin</CollapseTitle>
    <CollapseContent>
        Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.

    <CollapseTitle>Lama</CollapseTitle>
    <CollapseContent>
       Although they were often compared to sheep by early writers, their affinity to the camel was soon perceived. They were included in the genus Camelus in the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus. In 1800, Cuvier moved the llama, alpaca, and guanaco to the genus Lama, and the vicu√±a to the genus Vicugna. Later, the alpaca was transferred to Vicugna. These camelids are, with the two species of true camels, the sole extant representatives of a distinct section of Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) called Tylopoda, or "hump-footed", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. This section consists of a single family, the Camelidae, the other sections of the same great division being the Suina or pigs, the Tragulina or chevrotains, and the Pecora or true ruminants, to each of which the Tylopoda have some affinity, standing in some respects in a central position between them, sharing some characters from each, but showing special modifications not found in any of the others.
